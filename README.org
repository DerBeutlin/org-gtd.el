* org-gtd
* Summary
This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow (see GTD below).

At this early stage of the code, the package is destructive. It will overwrite the following variables. The ones marked with a =(!)= are the ones that may affect you the most:

- ~org-agenda-files~ (!)
- ~org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done~
- ~org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done~
- ~org-agenda-span~ (!)
- ~org-agenda-start-on-weekday~ (!)
- ~org-agenda-window-setup~
- ~org-capture-templates~ (!)
- ~org-outline-path-complete-in-steps~
- ~org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes~
- ~org-refile-targets~ (!)
- ~org-refile-use-outline-path~
- ~org-stuck-projects~

* Installing

This package will hopefully soon be on Melpa and Melpa Stable.

In the meanwhile, clone this repo to ~~/.emacs.d/packages~ then add this to your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(require 'org-gtd)
#+end_src

* Configuring
Either use ~M-x customize-group RET org-gtd RET~ or set the following variables:

- ~org-gtd-directory~ : the path where the GTD files will live
- ~org-gtd-actionable-file~ : name of the file holding projects. Ends in .org
- ~org-gtd-inbox-file~ : name of the file holding unprocessed items. Ends in .org
- ~org-gtd-someday-file~ : name of the file holding things to review and do someday. Ends in .org
- ~org-gtd-timely-file~ : name of the file holding scheduled events. Ends in .org

Then run ~(org-gtd-init)~. Run this function every time you change one of the above values.

It is suggested that you bind a few keys:

- ~(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)~
- ~(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)~
- ~(global-set-key "\C-ci" 'org-gtd-process-inbox)~
- ~(global-set-key "\C-cn" 'org-gtd-show-all-next)~
* Using

The four frequent actions from GTD map to emacs lisp actions this way:

| GTD                        | action                  | suggested keybinding |
|----------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------|
| Add to the inbox           | (org-capture)           | C-c c                |
| Process inbox              | (org-gtd-process-inbox) | C-c i                |
| See all next actions       | (org-gtd-show-all-next) | C-c n                |
| See what's coming up today | (org-agenda)            | C-c a a              |


TO NOTE, VERY IMPORTANT:

A "project" is defined as an org heading with a set of children headings. The project heading should not have a TODO tag. The first child should have a NEXT tag. All other children should have a TODO tag.

When you are processing the inbox and creating a project, emacs enters a recursive edit mode. This just means that, to tell emacs you are done creating the subtree, you have to press ~C-M-c~ to exit the recursive edit and go back to processing the inbox.
