* org-gtd
* Summary
This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow (see GTD below).

At this early stage of the code, the package is destructive. It will overwrite the following variables. The ones marked with a =(!)= are the ones that may affect you the most:

- ~org-agenda-files~ (!)
- ~org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done~
- ~org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done~
- ~org-agenda-span~ (!)
- ~org-agenda-start-on-weekday~ (!)
- ~org-agenda-window-setup~
- ~org-capture-templates~ (!)
- ~org-outline-path-complete-in-steps~
- ~org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes~
- ~org-refile-targets~ (!)
- ~org-refile-use-outline-path~
- ~org-stuck-projects~

* Installing

This package will hopefully soon be on Melpa and Melpa Stable.

In the meanwhile, clone this repo to ~~/.emacs.d/packages~ then add this to your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(load
#+end_src

* Configuring
Either use ~M-x customize-group RET org-gtd RET~ or set the following variables:

- ~org-gtd-directory~ : the path where the GTD files will live
- ~org-gtd-actionable-file~ : name of the file holding projects. Ends in .org
- ~org-gtd-inbox-file~ : name of the file holding unprocessed items. Ends in .org
- ~org-gtd-someday-file~ : name of the file holding things to review and do someday. Ends in .org
- ~org-gtd-timely-file~ : name of the file holding scheduled events. Ends in .org

Then run ~(org-gtd-init)~. Run this function every time you change one of the above values.

It is suggested that you bind a few keys:

- ~(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)~
- ~(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)~
- ~(global-set-key "\C-ci" 'org-gtd-process-inbox)~
- ~(global-set-key "\C-cn" 'org-gtd-show-all-next)~
* Using

The three frequent actions from GTD map to emacs lisp actions this way:

| GTD                  | action                  | suggested keybinding |
|----------------------+-------------------------+----------------------|
| Add to the inbox     | (org-capture)           | C-cc                 |
| Process inbox        | (org-gtd-process-inbox) | C-ci                 |
| See all next actions | (org-gtd-show-all-next) | C-cn                 |
