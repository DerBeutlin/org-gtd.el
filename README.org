** Using

This package, and this readme, assume familiarity with GTD. There are many resources out there to learn how to use the framework. If you are new to GTD, this package may be unpleasant to use.

I will assume you have used the suggested keybindings below.

GTD uses one basic axiom: everything that comes your way goes into the inbox. You do this with ~C-c d c~. You also have to regularly process the inbox, which you do with ~C-c d p~.

You have a number of possible choices for each item you process, which I will quickly go over. When you process the inbox, you will see each inbox item, one at a time, with an interface letting you decide what to do with the item:

[[file:doc/ogpi-1.png]]

- *Quick Action* :: You've taken care of this action just now. Choose this to mark the item as DONÎ• and archive it.
- *Throw out* :: This is not actionable and it's not knowledge for later. Choose this to mark the item as CANCELED and archive it.
- *Project* :: This is a multi-step action. I'll describe how to handle these below.
- *Calendar* :: This is a single item to be done at a given date or time. You'll be presented with org-mode's date picker, then it'll refile the item. You'll find this in the agenda later.
- *Delegate* :: Let someone else do this. Write the name of the person doing it, and choose a time to check up on that item.
- *Single action* :: This is a one-off to be done when possible. You can add tags to help you.
- *Reference* :: This is knowledge to be stored away. I'll describe how to handle these below.
- *Incubate* :: no action now, review later

When processing each item you'll get a chance to add tags and other such metadata. This package will add keywords (e.g. NEXT, TODO, DONE) for you, so don't worry about them. Do the work that only you can do, and let this package handle the bookkeeping.

*** Projects
A "project" is defined as an org heading with a set of children headings.
The package will add keywords (NEXT and TODO) as relevant.

When you are processing the inbox and creating a project, emacs enters a recursive edit mode to let you define and refine the project. When finished, press ~C-c C-c~ to exit the recursive edit and go back to processing the inbox.
*** Agenda
Here's what the agenda may look like when you've processed the inbox a bit.

*** Show next actions

One of the ways to see what's next for you to do is to see all the next actions ( ~C-c d n~ ).

[[file:doc/show-all-next.png]]
*** Projects without a NEXT item
Sometimes things break. Use ~C-c d s~ to find all projects that don't have a NEXT item, which is to say, all projects that the package will not surface and help you finish.
** Installing
This package requires emacs 26.1 or higher.
*** MELPA, MELPA stable

*** Using use-package with straight.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-gtd
    :after org
    :straight (:host github :repo "trevoke/org-gtd.el" :branch "master"))
#+end_src
*** Manually
Check out the source code for dependencies and install them.

Then, clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d/packages=

Finally, add this to your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(require 'org-gtd)
#+end_src
** Configuring
You can use ~M-x customize-group RET org-gtd RET~ if you like.

For your convenience, here's a commented block.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; these are the interactive functions you're likely to want to use as you go about GTD.
