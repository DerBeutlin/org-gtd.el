** Installing

This package requires emacs 26.1 or higher.

This package will hopefully soon be on Melpa and Melpa Stable.

In the meanwhile:

First, install ~org-edna~, ~org-brain~, and ~f~.

Then, clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d/packages=

Finally, add this to your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(require 'org-gtd)
#+end_src

** Configuring

*** I trust you let me just copy-paste the whole thing in my init file
Okay! Scroll past if you want more detailed explanations.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d a") 'org-agenda-list)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d i") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d s") 'org-gtd-show-stuck-projects)

  (setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")

  (setq org-agenda-files `(,org-gtd-directory))

  (setq org-capture-templates `(("i" "Inbox"
                                 entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox))
                                 "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i"
                                 :kill-buffer t)
                                ("t" "Todo with link"
                                 entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox))
                                 "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i\n  %a"
                                 :kill-buffer t)))

  (setq org-agenda-property-list '("DELEGATED_TO"))
  (setq org-agenda-property-position 'next-line)

  (setq org-edna-use-inheritance t)
  (org-edna-load)

  (setq org-brain-path (concat org-gtd-directory "brain"))

  (setq org-id-track-globally t)

  (setq org-brain-visualize-default-choices 'all)
  (setq org-brain-title-max-length 12)

*** Keybindings
It is suggested that you bind a few functions to keys:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d a") 'org-agenda-list)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d i") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d s") 'org-gtd-show-stuck-projects)
#+end_src

*** Variables specific to org-gtd
Either use ~M-x customize-group RET org-gtd RET~ or set the following variable.

- ~org-gtd-directory~ : the path where the GTD files will live. The default value is =~/gtd/=.
*** Variables from org-mode
**** org-agenda-files
If you aren't using any files yet, add ~(setq org-agenda-files `(,org-gtd-directory))~.

If you have it configured, you need to add our directory to it: ~(add-to-list 'org-agenda-files org-gtd-directory)~
**** org-capture-templates
We recommend the addition of the following two entries to your capture templates.

- ~i~ just adds a simple entry
- ~t~ adds an entry with a link to wherever you were in emacs when you decided to enter this todo

If you already have capture templates, of course, add to the list, don't just overwrite the setting.
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-capture-templates `(("i" "Inbox"
                                 entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox))
                                 "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i"
                                 :kill-buffer t)
                                ("t" "Todo with link"
                                 entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox))
                                 "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i\n  %a"
                                 :kill-buffer t)))

#+end_src
*** Other packages
**** org-agenda-property
This package displays headline properties in the agenda. We use it so you can quickly see to whom you delegated a task.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-property-list '("DELEGATED_TO"))
(setq org-agenda-property-position 'next-line) ;; not necessary, my preference
#+end_src

**** org-edna
~org-gtd~ needs ~org-edna~ to be loaded and using property inheritance, so you'll need to add this to your config file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-edna-use-inheritance t)
(org-edna-load)
#+end_src

**** org-brain
[[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]] is used as the reference store. if you weren't using it before, you'll need to configure it. Here is my configuration for reference. Note that there is one fragile thing here: the ~org-gtd-directory~ variable has to exist and it has to end with a =/=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-brain
    :init
    (setq org-brain-path (concat org-gtd-directory "brain"))
    ;; For Evil users
    ;; (with-eval-after-load 'evil
    ;;   (evil-set-initial-state 'org-brain-visualize-mode 'emacs))
    :config
    (setq org-id-track-globally t)
    (setq org-id-locations-file "~/.emacs.d/.org-id-locations")
    (setq org-brain-visualize-default-choices 'all)
    (setq org-brain-title-max-length 12))
#+end_src
** Using

I will assume you have used the suggested keybindings above for this explanation.

GTD uses one basic axiom: everything that comes your way goes into the inbox. You do this with ~C-c d c~. Once that's done, of course, you have to actually process the inbox, which you do with ~C-c d i~.

You have a number of possible choices for each item you process, which I will quickly go over. When you process the inbox, you will be greeted with this interface for each item:

[[file:ogpi-1.png]]

1. *Garbage* (~g~) - This is not actionable and it's not knowledge for later. Choose this to mark the item as CANCELED and archive it.
2. *Quick Action* (~q~) - You've taken care of this action just now. Choose this to mark the item as DONÎ• and archive it.
3. *Schedule* (~s~) - This is a single item to be done at a given date or time. You'll be presented with org-mode's date picker, then it'll refile the item. You'll find this in the agenda later.
4. *Delegate* (~d~) - Let someone else do this. Write the name of the person doing it, and choose a time to check up on that item.
5. *Whenever* (~w~) - This is a one-off to be done when possible. You can add tags to help you (refer to GTD book).
6. Later
7. *Project* (~p~) - This is a multi-step action. I'll describe how to handle these below.
8. *Reference* (~r~) - This is knowledge to be stored away. I'll describe how to handle these below.

*** Projects
A "project" is defined as an org heading with a set of children headings. The project heading should not have a TODO tag. The first child should have a NEXT tag. All other children should have a TODO tag.

When you are processing the inbox and creating a project, emacs enters a recursive edit mode to let you define and refine the project. When finished, press ~C-c C-c~ to exit the recursive edit and go back to processing the inbox.
