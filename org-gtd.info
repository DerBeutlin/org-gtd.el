1.1 Summary
===========

This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow
(see diagram below).

   This package, and this documentation, assume familiarity with the
flow of GTD as described in the book.

   This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming
things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item
based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today’s
items as well as the NEXT items.  It also has a simple project
management system, which currently assumes all tasks in a project are
sequential.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Installing,  Next: Configuring,  Prev: Upgrading,  Up: Org GTD

1.3 Installing
==============

This package requires emacs 27.1 or higher.

   This package is on MELPA and MELPA stable under the name ‘org-gtd’.

* Menu:

* use-package::
* Manually::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: use-package,  Next: Manually,  Up: Installing

1.3.1 use-package
-----------------

Just make sure this is loaded after ‘org-mode’ like so.
     (use-package org-gtd :after org)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Manually,  Prev: use-package,  Up: Installing

1.3.2 Manually
--------------

Check out the source code for dependencies and install them.  Then,
clone this repo to a directory of your choice, e.g.
‘~/.emacs.d/packages’.  Finally, add this to your config:
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
     (require 'org-gtd)

1.4 Configuring
===============

* Menu:

* The easy way::
* required configuration of sub-packages::
* configuration options for org-gtd::
* Recommended key bindings::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The easy way,  Next: required configuration of sub-packages,  Up: Configuring

1.4.1 The easy way
------------------

Just turn on ‘org-gtd-mode’ (‘M-x org-gtd-mode’).  This will set up
emacs, Org mode, and Org GTD’s dependencies.  Turn off ‘org-gtd-mode’ to
restore emacs to pre-org-gtd settings.

   Note, you should still head over to the *note Recommended key
bindings:: section.

--------------------------------------------

* Menu:

* org-edna::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: org-edna,  Up: required configuration of sub-packages

org-edna
........

package: <https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/>

   This is one of the dependencies.  This setting change is REQUIRED.
It automatically changes the next TODO heading to NEXT in a project when
you’ve finished the current task.

   You do not need to make this change if you choose to toggle
‘org-gtd-mode’.
     (setq org-edna-use-inheritance t)
     (org-edna-mode 1)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: configuration options for org-gtd,  Next: Recommended key bindings,  Prev: required configuration of sub-packages,  Up: Configuring

1.4.3 configuration options for org-gtd
---------------------------------------

The best way to find out about the configuration options for org-gtd is
to see the customize group: ‘M-x customize-group RET org-gtd’.  They are
all optional because they all come with default values.

   The only one you may want to change before starting to use Org GTD is
‘org-gtd-directory’, which is the directory that Org GTD will look to
for everything it needs to do.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Recommended key bindings,  Prev: configuration options for org-gtd,  Up: Configuring

1.4.4 Recommended key bindings
------------------------------

There’s an important keymap you’ll want to make the flow of processing
the inbox smoother.  I suggest ‘C-c c’.

     (define-key org-gtd-process-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-choose)

   • org-gtd-agenda-cancel-project
   • org-gtd-agenda-daily
   • org-gtd-agenda-delegate
   • org-gtd-agenda-projectify
   • org-gtd-archive-completed-items
   • org-gtd-cancel-project
   • org-gtd-capture
   • org-gtd-choose
   • org-gtd-delegate
   • org-gtd-mode
   • org-gtd-process-inbox
   • org-gtd-show-all-next
   • org-gtd-show-stuck-projects

     (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
      ("C-c d a" . org-agenda-list)
      ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)
      ("C-c d n" . org-gtd-show-all-next)
      ("C-c d s" . org-gtd-show-stuck-projects))

     ;; this is used in a very specific minor mode, so you can have a pretty common keybinding.
     :bind (:map org-gtd-process-map
                   ("C-c c" . org-gtd-clarify-finalize))

1.5 Using
=========

* Menu:

* Regular use::
* Projects::
* Agenda::
* Show next actions::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Regular use,  Next: Projects,  Up: Using

1.5.1 Regular use
-----------------

I will assume you have used the suggested keybindings above.

   GTD uses one basic axiom: everything that comes your way goes into
the inbox.  You do this with ‘C-c d c’.  You also have to regularly
process the inbox, which you do with ‘C-c d p’.

   You have a number of possible choices for each item you process,
which I will quickly go over.  When you process the inbox, you will see
each inbox item, one at a time, with an interface letting you decide
what to do with the item (shown below with ‘C-h’ for extra information):

 [image src="doc/processing-menu.png" ]

*Quick Action*
     You’ve taken care of this action just now.  Choose this to mark the
     item as DONΕ and archive it.
*Throw out*
     This is not actionable and it’s not knowledge for later.  Choose
     this to mark the item as CNCL and archive it.
*Project*
     This is a multi-step action.  I’ll describe how to handle these
     below.
*Calendar*
     This is a single item to be done at a given date or time.  You’ll
     be presented with org-mode’s date picker, then it’ll refile the
     item.  You’ll find this in the agenda later.
*Delegate*
     Let someone else do this.  Write the name of the person doing it,
     and choose a time to check up on that item.
*Single action*
     This is a one-off to be done when possible.  You can add tags to
     help you.
*Reference*
     This is knowledge to be stored away.  I’ll describe how to handle
     these below.
*Incubate*
     no action now, review later

   When processing each item, the following will happen:
  1. You’ll enter an editing mode where you can refine the wording,
     create additional sub-headlines, add your own tags and other such
     metadata
  2. You’ll hit a keybinding of your choice (recommended: ‘C-c c’, see
     config below) to confirm your work and move on to the next item
  3. when you move on to the next item, ‘org-gtd’ will add keywords
     (NEXT, TODO, DONE, etc.)  in order to handle the bookkeeping and
     get you set up with org-agenda and the other provided org-gtd
     functions.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Projects,  Next: Agenda,  Prev: Regular use,  Up: Using

1.5.2 Projects
--------------

A "project" is defined as a top-level org heading with a set of
second-level org headings.  When you choose "project" and enter the
editing mode, create such a headline structure, like in the following
example.

   file:doc/project-processing.png (doc/project-processing.png)

   As indicated above, when you are finished creating your headline
structure, hit your chosen keybinding to exit the edit mode (in the
above screenshot, ‘C-c c’) and move on to processing the next item.

   A project is defined as "completed" when all its tasks are marked as
DONE.  A project is defined as "canceled" when its last task is marked
as CNCL.

   You can cancel a project by calling ‘org-gtd-agenda-cancel-project’
from the agenda view, when the point is on the next task of the project.

   DO NOTE: it is surprisingly difficult to add a custom note when
canceling, so if you want to add a note explaining why you canceled the
project, you will have to do so manually.

   You can archive (move to the archive file, using the org-mode
feature) completed and canceled projects by using
‘org-gtd-archive-completed-items’.

Multiple files / refile targets
...............................

If you would like to add a new refile targets, it’s simple.  Add a
top-level heading and make sure it has the following properties drawer:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :TRIGGER: next-sibling todo!(NEXT)
     :ORG_GTD: Projects

1.5.3 Agenda
------------

Here’s what the agenda may look like when you’ve processed the inbox a
bit.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Show next actions,  Prev: Agenda,  Up: Using

1.5.4 Show next actions
-----------------------

One of the ways to see what’s next for you to do is to see all the next
actions ( ‘C-c d n’ ).

1.6 Troubleshooting
===================

* Menu:

* Projects without a NEXT item::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Projects without a NEXT item,  Up: Troubleshooting

1.6.1 Projects without a NEXT item
----------------------------------

Sometimes things break.  Use ‘C-c d s’ to find all projects that don’t
have a NEXT item, which is to say, all projects that the package will
not surface and help you finish.
