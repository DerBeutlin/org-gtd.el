;;; Commentary:

;; This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
;; This package assumes familiarity with GTD.
;;
;; Upgrading? make sure you read the CHANGELOG.
;;
;; This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming things
;; into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item based on the
;; GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's items as well as the
;; NEXT items.  It also has a simple project management system, which currently
;; assumes all tasks in a project are sequential.
;;
;; For a comprehensive instruction manual, see the file `README.org'.
