** Massive readme revamp
the readme was a cluttered mess, I've broken it down into a lot of subsections. I hope it will be easier to manage now.
** org-gtd-process-item-hooks
Based on an idea in https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/discussions/54

There's now an available variable that you can use to extend and customize the behavior of item processing. If you come up with cool ideas, share them!
* 1.0.3
I dunno why this tag existed but we're skipping this I guess.

** Fix inability to refile to incubate
While processing the inbox, it was impossible to refile to the incubate file properly.
This release fixes that bug.

To note:
If you haven't yet, make sure you go to the incubate file and set up some categories for yourself, e.g. `* To Read`, `* To Eat`, etc. ~org-gtd~ currently handles up to two headline levels, so you could do `* To Read` and `** Horror` if you wanted
