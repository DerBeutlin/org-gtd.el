** Fix inability to refile to incubate
While processing the inbox, it was impossible to refile to the incubate file properly.
This release fixes that bug.

To note:
If you haven't yet, make sure you go to the incubate file and set up some categories for yourself, e.g. `* To Read`, `* To Eat`, etc. ~org-gtd~ currently handles up to two headline levels, so you could do `* To Read` and `** Horror` if you wanted
