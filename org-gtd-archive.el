  "Archive sublevels of the current tree that match PREDICATE.

PREDICATE is a function of two arguments, BEG and END, which
specify the beginning and end of the headline being considered.
It is called with point positioned at BEG.  The headline will be
archived if PREDICATE returns non-nil.  If the return value of
PREDICATE is a string, it should describe the reason for
archiving the heading.

If the cursor is not on a headline, try all level 1 trees.  If it
is on a headline, try all direct children.  When TAG is non-nil,
don't move trees, but mark them with the ARCHIVE tag.

This function was shamelessly copied-and-modified from org-archive.
