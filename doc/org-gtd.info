1.1 Summary
===========

This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow
(see diagram below).

   This package, and this documentation, assume familiarity with the
flow of GTD as described in the book.

   This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming
things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item
based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today’s
items as well as the NEXT items.  It also has a simple project
management system, which currently assumes all tasks in a project are
sequential.

Configuration
.............

Org GTD now handles dependency loading more intelligently, so you no
longer need the overly complicated setup of ‘org-gtd’, ‘org-agenda’ and
‘org-capure’ in your config for dependency loading.  You now only need
‘org-gtd’.  If you are using ‘use-package’ then the following is the
minimal config required.

     (use-package org-gtd :after 'org)

   You no longer need to configure ‘org-agenda-property-list’ yourself.
Org GTD now manages the context with a macro, ‘with-org-gtd-context’.
Any prior configuration of this subpackage can be handled as you did
before.

   You no longer need to configure ‘org-agenda-files’.  Same reason as
above.  This allows you to use org-gtd without destroying your previous
setup, and makes it easier to try org-gtd and then get rid of it if you
don’t like it.

   You no longer need to configure ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  Now
there’s ‘org-gtd-agenda-custom-commands’ to take the relay - see the
variable documentation for more information.

   The org-capture templates are now simplified and managed by
‘org-gtd-capture-templates’.  If you did not change the default
configuration, then you can just remove what you had.  Read the variable
documentaton for further information.

   • Example upgrade

     My org-gtd config for 1.x was:
          (use-package org-gtd
            :after org
            :demand t
            :pin melpa
            :custom
            (org-gtd-directory stag-org-gtd-directory)
            (org-agenda-property-list '("DELEGATED_TO"))
            (org-edna-use-inheritance t)
            :config
            (org-edna-load)
            :bind
            (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
             ("C-c d a" . org-agenda-list)
             ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)

             :map org-gtd-process-map
             ("C-c c" . org-gtd-choose)))


          (use-package org-agenda
            :ensure nil
            :no-require t
            :after (org-gtd)
            :custom
            (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)
            (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)
            (org-agenda-files `(,org-gtd-directory))
            (org-agenda-custom-commands '(("g" "Scheduled today and all NEXT items" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 1))) (todo "NEXT"))))))

          (use-package org-capture
            :ensure nil
            :after org-gtd
            :config
            (setq org-capture-templates `(("i" "Inbox"
                                         entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox-file-basename))
                                         "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i"
                                         :kill-buffer t)
                                        ("t" "Todo with link"
                                         entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox-file-basename))
                                         "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i\n  %a"
                                         :kill-buffer t))))

     And my config for 2.0 is:
          (use-package org-gtd
            :after org
            :quelpa (org-gtd :fetcher github :repo "trevoke/org-gtd.el"
                             :branch "2.0.0" :upgrade t)
            :demand t
            :custom
            (org-gtd-directory stag-org-gtd-directory)
            (org-edna-use-inheritance t)
            :config
            (org-edna-mode)
            :bind
            (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
             ("C-c d e" . org-gtd-engage)
             ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)
             ("C-c d n" . org-gtd-show-all-next)
             ("C-c d s" . org-gtd-show-stuck-projects)
             :map org-gtd-process-map

Relevant commands with new names
................................

heading states (TODO, etc.)
...........................

You need to rename CANCELED to CNCL.  a simple string replace in the
‘org-gtd-directory’ will do the trick.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Differentiating GTD types of items,  Next: Multiple refile targets,  Prev: heading states (TODO etc),  Up: 200 <- 11x

Differentiating GTD types of items
..................................

Org GTD no longer uses the name of the heading to figure out how to
refile things, and which headings are useful.  Instead it uses a custom
Org property called ORG_GTD. This means you are free to rename the
existing headings whatever you want, but you DO need to make some
adjustments to your current files.

   If you would like to add new refile targets, it’s simple, follow
these instructions.

   For projects, make sure the heading has the following two properties.
     :PROPERTIES:
     :TRIGGER: next-sibling todo!(NEXT)
     :ORG_GTD: Projects
     :END:

   For other headings, make sure there is an ORG_GTD property, like for
the project, above.

   The other ORG_GTD properties are set as follows.  Note that Single
and Delegated actions are together now, so you can merge those headings
if you want.

Scheduled actions
     ‘ORG_GTD: Calendar’
Single & Delegated actions
     ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’
Incubated actions
     ‘ORG_GTD: Incubated’

   For incubated actions, version 1.x of Org GTD asked for second-level
heading, such as ‘*To Read’.  No more - these are now top-level
headings, exactly as described above, with a heading property of
‘ORG_GTD: Incubated’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Multiple refile targets,  Next: Key bindings,  Prev: Differentiating GTD types of items,  Up: 200 <- 11x

Multiple refile targets
.......................

There is a new variable, ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’.  By default
this variable is set to ‘t’.  This means that Org GTD will refile to
whatever the first target it finds is.  This is the default value
because it most closely matches the behavior for version 1.x.  *THIS
BEHAVIOR ALSO APPLIES TO INCUBATE REFILE TARGETS*. Therefore, if you
have multiple incubated refile targets, you will need to set this
variable to ‘nil’, or change to a single refile target.  You can e.g.
set a custom property to describe the kind of incubated item it is, if
it is useful to you, something like:

     * Incubated
     ** Buy a boat
     SCHEDULED: <2035-06-01 Fri>
     :PROPERTIES:
     :INCUBATE: big financial investment
     :END:


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Key bindings,  Prev: Multiple refile targets,  Up: 200 <- 11x

Key bindings
............

Version 1.x of Org GTD recommended a binding for
‘org-gtd-clarify-finalize’.  This binding must now be set as follows
(replace the keybinding with one of your choice):

     (define-key org-gtd-process-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-choose)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Installing,  Next: Configuring,  Prev: Upgrading,  Up: Org GTD

1.3 Installing
==============

This package requires emacs 27.1 or higher.

   This package is on MELPA and MELPA stable under the name ‘org-gtd’.

* Menu:

* use-package::
* Manually::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: use-package,  Next: Manually,  Up: Installing

1.3.1 use-package
-----------------

Just make sure this is loaded after ‘org-mode’ like so.
     (use-package org-gtd :after org)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Manually,  Prev: use-package,  Up: Installing

1.3.2 Manually
--------------

Check out the source code for dependencies and install them.  Then,
clone this repo to a directory of your choice, e.g.
‘~/.emacs.d/packages’.  Finally, add this to your config:
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
     (require 'org-gtd)

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The easy way,  Next: Required configuration of sub-packages,  Up: Configuring

1.4.1 The easy way
------------------

Just turn on ‘org-gtd-mode’ (‘M-x org-gtd-mode’).  This will set up
emacs, Org mode, and Org GTD’s dependencies.  Turn off ‘org-gtd-mode’ to
restore emacs to pre-org-gtd settings.

   Note, you should still head over to the *note Recommended key
bindings:: section.

   This is one of the dependencies.  This setting change is REQUIRED.
It automatically changes the next TODO heading to NEXT in a project when
you’ve finished the current task.

   You do not need to make this change if you choose to toggle
‘org-gtd-mode’.

1.4.3 configuration options for org-gtd
---------------------------------------

The most direct way to find out about the configuration options for
org-gtd is to see the customize group: ‘M-x customize-group RET
org-gtd’.  They are all optional because they all come with default
values.

   The only one you may want to change before starting to use Org GTD is
‘org-gtd-directory’, which is the directory that Org GTD will look to
for everything it needs to do.

   The configuration options will also be mentioned in the relevant
subsections of *note Using Org GTD::.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Recommended key bindings,  Prev: configuration options for org-gtd,  Up: Configuring

1.4.4 Recommended key bindings
------------------------------

There’s an important keymap you’ll want to make the flow of processing
the inbox smoother.  To limit impact on your emacs configuration, there
is a specific keymap you can use.  The function you’ll want to bind is
‘org-gtd-choose’.  I suggest ‘C-c c’, as in the following example.

     (define-key org-gtd-process-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-choose)

   For other keybindings, do what you need.  My bindings use ‘C-c d’ as
a prefix, i.e.:

‘C-c d c’
     ‘org-gtd-capture’
‘C-c d e’
     ‘org-gtd-engage’

   etc.

2 Using Org GTD
***************

Here are the categories of actions from GTD that we have to be able to
handle:

   • adding things to the inbox
   • processing the inbox
   • Engage with your GTD system
   • cleaning up / archiving completed work

   Other elements of GTD, such as reviews, are currently unimplemented:
as the user, you can simply open the files to review things for now.

* Menu:

* Adding things to the inbox::
* Processing the inbox::
* Engaging with your GTD items::
* Cleaning up / archiving completed work::
* Multiple files / refile targets::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding things to the inbox,  Next: Processing the inbox,  Up: Using Org GTD

2.1 Adding things to the inbox
==============================

The inbox is a file called ‘inbox.org’ in the directory stored in the
variable ‘org-gtd-directory’.  By default this variable is ‘~/gtd’.

   Org GTD provides one function to capture items: ‘M-x
org-gtd-capture’.  In my setup I have this booked globally as such:

     (global-set-key "C-c d c" #'org-gtd-capture)

   This function overrides ‘org-capture’ and uses the variable
‘org-gtd-capture-templates’ to define org-gtd-specific capture
templates.  By default it comes with two templates, one to just capture
a new item, and one to capture an item with a link to the file where you
were when you started the capture.

2.2 Processing the inbox
========================

Processing the inbox means taking everything in the inbox, one at a
time, and refining/categorizing them so they are instantly useful when
you are looking at available next / scheduled actions.

   You can start processing the inbox with ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’.
This will select the inbox buffer and hide everything but the first item
in the inbox, then give you control to refine it.

   When you are done refining it, call ‘M-x org-gtd-choose’ (or hit your
keybinding for it, see *note Recommended key bindings::).  This will
open a transient menu to let you choose how Org GTD should categorize
this item.

   You have a number of possible choices for each item you process.
Subsections will explain how Org GTD handles each one.

*[Q]uick Action*
     Quick action.  Do it now, then choose this to mark the item as DONΕ
     and archive it.
*[T]rash*
     This is not actionable and it’s not knowledge for later.  Choose
     this to mark the item as CNCL and archive it.
*[P]roject*
     This is a multi-step action.  I’ll describe how to handle these
     below.
*[C]alendar*
     This is a single item to be done at a given date or time.  You’ll
     be presented with org-mode’s date picker, then it’ll refile the
     item.  You’ll find this in the agenda later.
*[D]elegate*
     Let someone else do this.  Write the name of the person doing it,
     and choose a time to check up on that item.
*[S]ingle action*
     This is a one-off to be done when possible.
*[A]rchive*
     This is knowledge to be stored away.
*[I]ncubate*
     no action now, review later

   In addition you have *[X]* for "exit early", which you can use to
stop processing the inbox and restore emacs to its non-inbox-processing
state.

   After the item-type-specific behavior, you will have the option to
add custom decorations to each item, based on how you prefer to think
about (filter, find, etc.)  the items when you do GTD.

   The decorations are tracked in ‘org-gtd-process-item-hooks’, a list
of functions.  By default there is one element in the list, to add tags
to the item.

   This process will continue, item after item, until you hit *x* to
exit early or until you run out of items to process.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Quick action,  Next: Trash,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.1 Quick action
------------------

When you choose quick action, you indicate that not much more tracking
is necessary.  This item is automatically marked as DONE and archived,
then Org GTD moves on to the next item.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Trash,  Next: Calendar,  Prev: Quick action,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.2 Trash
-----------

When you choose trash, the item is automatically marked as CNCL and
archived, then Org GTD moves on to the next item.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Calendar,  Next: Delegate,  Prev: Trash,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.3 Calendar
--------------

When you you choose calendar, you will be asked to select a date (and
time if you choose to add it), then Org GTD moves on to the next item.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Delegate,  Next: Single action,  Prev: Calendar,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.4 Delegate
--------------

When you choose delegate, you’ll be asked for a name to whom to delegate
this to, and a date on which to check in with the person.  Org GTD
automatically marks this item as "WAIT", then Org GTD moves on to the
next item.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Single action,  Next: Archive,  Prev: Delegate,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.5 Single action
-------------------

When you choose single action, Org GTD will mark it as a NEXT item, then
Org GTD moves on to the next item.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Archive,  Next: Incubate,  Prev: Single action,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.6 Archive
-------------

When you choose archive, Org GTD will assume you have done what you
needed to do to store this (e.g.  put the information in org roam, bbdb,
or wherever you will store it), then marks the item as DONE and archives
it.  Org GTD then moves on to the next item.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Incubate,  Next: Projects,  Prev: Archive,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.7 Incubate
--------------

Incubating an item is similar to simply scheduling one, though the idea
is that you want to be reminded of it much later, and be able to review
your incubated items separately.  So, all this will really do is make
you choose a date at which you want to be reminded of this, then it’ll
be refiled under an incubated target.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Projects,  Prev: Incubate,  Up: Processing the inbox

2.2.8 Projects
--------------

A "project" is defined as a top-level org heading with a set of
second-level org headings.  When you choose "project" and enter the
editing mode, create such a headline structure, like in the following
example.

     * Project heading
     ** First task
     ** Second task
     ** Third task

   Then call ‘M-x org-gtd-choose’ or hit your chosen keybinding, tell
Org GTD you chose a project, and move on with your life.

   A project is defined as "completed" when all its tasks are marked as
DONE.  A project is defined as "canceled" when its last task is marked
as CNCL.

   You can cancel a project by calling ‘org-gtd-agenda-cancel-project’
from the agenda view, when the point is on the next task of the project.

   DO NOTE: it is surprisingly difficult to add a custom note when
canceling, so if you want to add a note explaining why you canceled the
project, you will have to do so manually.

2.3 Engaging with your GTD items
================================

You can see a list of all NEXT actions, and scheduled actions, with ‘M-x
org-gtd-engage’ .  This opens an ‘org-agenda’ view.

   The variable ‘org-gtd-agenda-custom-commands’ has the settings to
define what gets shown in that function.

   You can define other functions by adding new custom commands to the
above, and defining your own functions like so, where "x" is whatever
your defined key is.

     (defun my-agenda ()
       (with-org-gtd-context
           (org-agenda nil "x")))

   You can call ‘org-gtd-show-all-next’ to only see NEXT actions,
nothing scheduled.

* Interacting with org-agenda::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Interacting with org-agenda,  Up: Engaging with your GTD items

2.3.1 Interacting with org-agenda
---------------------------------

Since Org provides the agenda, it is a convenient base of operations for
interacting with things that come up through ‘org-gtd-engage’.

   Here are the actions available to you:

‘M-x org-gtd-agenda-cancel-project’
     When the point is on a project action, this command will cancel the
     remaining actions in the project.
‘M-x org-gtd-agenda-delegate’
     When the point is on an action, this will properly delegate the
     action to someone else.
‘M-x org-gtd-agenda-projectify’
     This is intended to be used on an incubated item that has come up.
     Behavior in other situations has not been tested.  This will
     properly let you transform an incubated item into a project.

2.4 Cleaning up / archiving completed work
==========================================

Doing this without user intervention is tricky, as it makes undoing
actions more complicated.  As such, Org GTD provides a function that
will go through the ‘org-gtd-directory’ files, find the headings that
belong to Org GTD (see *note Multiple files / refile targets::), and
archive the finished items.

   The variable ‘org-gtd-archive-location’ hosts a *function* that
returns a string matching the ‘org-archive-location’ definition.  It is
a function in order to make the filename entirely dynamic.

   The function to archive everything is ‘M-x
org-gtd-archive-completed-items’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Multiple files / refile targets,  Prev: Cleaning up / archiving completed work,  Up: Using Org GTD

2.5 Multiple files / refile targets
===================================

If you would like to add new refile targets, it’s simple, follow these
instructions.

* Menu:

* New project heading::
* Other headings::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: New project heading,  Next: Other headings,  Up: Multiple files / refile targets

2.5.1 New project heading
-------------------------

Add a top-level heading in any ‘.org’ file (including a new one) in
‘org-gtd-directory’ and make sure it has the following properties
drawer.
     :PROPERTIES:
     :TRIGGER: next-sibling todo!(NEXT)
     :ORG_GTD: Projects
     :END:


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Other headings,  Prev: New project heading,  Up: Multiple files / refile targets

2.5.2 Other headings
--------------------

Create a new top-level heading in any ‘.org’ file (including a new one)
and make sure it has an ORG_GTD property as such.
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ORG_GTD: Action
     :END:

   The ORG_GTD properties are set as follows, except for Projects (see
*note New project heading::):

Scheduled actions
     ‘ORG_GTD: Calendar’
Incubated actions
     ‘ORG_GTD: Incubated’
Single & Delegated actions
     ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Projects without a NEXT item,  Up: Troubleshooting

3.1 Projects without a NEXT item
================================

Sometimes things break.  Use ‘M-x org-gtd-show-stuck-projects’ to find
all projects that don’t have a NEXT item, which is to say, all projects
that the package will not surface and help you finish.
